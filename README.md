Challenges Faced and Solutions
During the development of my portfolio, I encountered a few challenges. Here are some of them and how I overcame them:

Challenge 1: Responsive design across different devices.

Solution: I used CSS media queries and responsive design techniques to ensure that the portfolio website looks and functions well on different screen sizes.
Challenge 2: Optimizing performance and load times.

Solution: I implemented code splitting techniques and lazy loading for components and images to optimize the performance and reduce initial load times.
Challenge 3: Integrating external libraries and APIs.

Solution: I carefully followed the documentation of the libraries and APIs I wanted to use and integrated them into my project following the provided guidelines and examples.
